## Introduction

Paraphrase generation is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in content rephrasing, text augmentation, and improving model robustness. This repository utilizes powerful pretrained Transformer models, such as BERT, GPT, or T5, fine-tuned on specialized paraphrase datasets to generate diverse and contextually accurate paraphrases.

## Features

- Pretrained Transformer models fine-tuned for paraphrase generation.
- Support for task-specific datasets to achieve high-quality results.
- Configurable training scripts for fine-tuning models on custom datasets.
- Easy-to-use interface for generating paraphrases with a single command.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
https://github.com/devrahulbanjara/Paraphrase-Generation-using-Transformers
cd Paraphrase-Generation-using-Transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate paraphrases using the fine-tuned model:

```bash
python generate_paraphrases.py --input "Your input text here"
```

To fine-tune a pretrained Transformer model on a custom dataset:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --dataset_path <path-to-dataset> --output_dir <path-to-save-model>
```

## Model Architecture

This project supports various pretrained Transformer models such as:

- **BERT**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
- **GPT**: Generative Pretrained Transformer for text generation.
- **T5**: Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer for a unified text-to-text framework.

The models are fine-tuned on paraphrase datasets to learn rephrasing while retaining the original meaning.

## Datasets

The repository supports commonly used paraphrase datasets like:

- **Quora Question Pairs**
- **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**
- **ParaNMT**

Custom datasets can also be provided for fine-tuning by formatting them into a compatible structure (e.g., input-output text pairs).

## Future Plans

- Add support for multilingual paraphrase generation.
- Integrate beam search and nucleus sampling for improved output quality.
- Provide pretrained models for direct usage without fine-tuning.
- Develop a web-based demo for easy testing of paraphrase generation.
